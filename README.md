This collection of nodes is part of the node-red extension to the free open source [SIP irrigation control software](http://dan-in-ca.github.io/SIP/) for Raspberry Pi:  

These nodes allow you to easily use node-red flows to control SIP and add new features such as a simple day-night timer for landscape lighting  
[flow image]  
to experimantal flows implementing advanced algorythms for controlling irrigation based on data from soil moisture sensors, online weather sites or a local weather station.

Among the advantages of using node-red flows to interact with SIP is that you can easily make changes "on the fly" while SIP is running.

For anyone wanting to dig deeper into SIP's inner workings there is also documentation for advanced users that describes how to read and write almost all of SIP's control variables from node-red.
